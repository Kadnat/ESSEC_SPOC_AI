### SECTION 2: LIVE DEMO - CV #1 (0:30 - 1:50)

**Profile: Interior Designer / Decorator**

**[Screen: JobMatch AI homepage]**

**Narration:**

> "Here's our interface. Let's start with the first CV - an **interior designer** with experience in decoration and space planning."

**[Action: Drag and drop CV file]**

> "I simply upload the CV in PDF format. The system accepts both PDF and DOCX files up to 10MB."

**[Screen: Analysis in progress - 4-7 seconds]**

> "Behind the scenes, **GPT-4o-mini extracts structured information** from the CV - name, skills, experience, education. Then, our **semantic matching engine compares this profile to 1,584 French job roles** using Sentence Transformers to calculate compatibility scores."

**[Screen: Results appear - Profile section]**

> "Perfect! Here's the analysis. Notice the profile shows **Kelly G.** - we've anonymized personal data for this demo. The AI extracted **15 technical skills** including AutoCAD, SketchUp, color theory, and project management.
>
> Most importantly, look at the **AI-generated insights** at the bottom. GPT analyzed the entire profile and provided personalized career advice in English."

**[Action: Click on "Recommended Jobs" tab]**

> "Now, the **Recommended Jobs tab** shows the top 5 matching careers. The best match is **Interior Designer with 87% compatibility**. Each recommendation shows:
> - The job description from the ROME database
> - Required skills that match the profile
> - **Missing skills highlighted in orange** - for example, 3D rendering software
>
> This helps candidates understand exactly what they need to develop."

**[Action: Click on "Real Job Offers" tab]**

> "The **Real Job Offers tab** is where the magic happens. We queried France Travail's official API and found **20 actual job postings** for interior designers. Each offer shows:
